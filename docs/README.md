# Dotfiles

This is a modular and scalable setup designed for managing dotfiles configurations across multiple platforms. Each platform is represented by a dedicated Git branch, ensuring clean separation of platform-specific configurations while keeping common configurations in a base branch.

> **Note**: The `master` branch holds shared configurations for all platforms. Both the `unix` and `windows` branches inherit from `master`, with `unix` serving as a base for Unix-based platforms like `darwin` and `linux`, while the `windows` branch adds configurations specific to Windows environments. Each platform-specific branch sets up its own configurations and acts as the primary entry point for that platform.

Below is a visual representation of how the branches are organized:

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone --branch <platform-branch-name> https://github.com/<mariusmucenicu>/<dotfiles>.git dotfiles
cd dotfiles
```

Replace `<platform-branch-name>` with your platform of choice:
- `darwin`
- `windows`
- `linux`


### 2. Run the Bootstrap Script

Each branch includes a platform-specific entry point in the `scripts` directory. For example:

#### Darwin & Linux:
```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

#### Windows:
```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1
```
